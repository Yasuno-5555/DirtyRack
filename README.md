# DirtyRack

**Deterministic Eurorack Simulator & Modular DSP Engine**

DirtyRack is a **high-precision deterministic Eurorack simulator** that merges bit-perfect reproducibility with physical modular interaction. It is designed for artists and engineers who love the "chaos" and "fluctuations" of analog but demand digital "Accountability."

More than just a synthesizer, it is a **Forensic Audio Infrastructure** that treats sound as a diagnosable medical case. It freezes the entire state of a patch, performance gestures, and the flow of time, making them verifiable via hash values.

## Core Design Philosophy

*   **Deterministic Chaos (Gehenna Engine)**: Handles chaos attractors and non-linear feedback while guaranteeing 1-bit accuracy for the same seed and input.
*   **Massive Polyphony (16ch)**: Native support for VCV Rack-compatible 16-channel polyphonic cables. A single connection yields orchestral density.
*   **Acoustic Forensics**: A forensic layer that proves "why this sound happened." The **Patch MRI** allows real-time dissection of internal thermal states and individual component variances.
*   **The Spec is Absolute**: Adheres to the **.dirtyrack Open Specification**, ensuring that your sound design is portable, verifiable, and permanent.
*   **Forensic Observation**: Implementations like the **Divergence Map** and **Provenance Timeline** allow users to trace the causality of sound design choices.

## Key Features

1.  **Gehenna Parallel Engine**: A second-generation parallel DSP engine optimized for SIMD, delivering deterministic analog "personality" across 16 voices.
2.  **Patch MRI (Pathology Scan)**: Visualize signal trauma in real-time. Detect clipping (Glow), energy density (Heatmap), and DC Drift (Aura) directly on module faceplates.
3.  **Provenance Timeline**: A chronological map of every parameter change and snapshot. Traces the "intent" behind the sound.
4.  **Forensic Inspector**: Deeply analyze the internal state of modules. Includes an **Explain Why** button that generates medical-style diagnostic reports for signal abnormalities.
5.  **.dirtyrack Spec v1.0**: A standardized format for patches (`.dirty`) and audit certificates (`.dirty.cert`). Enables "Acoustic Notarization."
6.  **Differential Audit**: Compare two snapshots or renders at sample precision. Detect exactly what changed between iterations.
7.  **Verification CLI**: A command-line utility for CI/CD and production environments. Run `dirty verify` to ensure the integrity of your audio output.

### Distribution & Formats

- **Standalone App**: Provides a `.app` bundle for macOS. Ready to use via drag-and-drop to `/Applications`.
- **VST3 / CLAP Plugin**: Operates as a 16ch polyphonic modular inside DAWs (Ableton, Bitwig, Reaper, etc.).
- **CLI Tool**: A command-line interface for deterministic offline rendering and hash verification.

## Quick Start

### Standalone (macOS)
```bash
# Copy DirtyRack.app from the root to /Applications
open ./DirtyRack.app
```

### Plugin Deployment
Place the generated `DirtyRack.clap` from the root into your plugin folder.

**To use as VST3**:
1. Create a directory structure: `DirtyRack.vst3/Contents/MacOS/`.
2. Copy and rename `DirtyRack.clap` to `DirtyRack` inside that directory.
